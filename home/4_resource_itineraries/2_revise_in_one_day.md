# 2. Revise in one day
Suggestions from [this video](https://youtu.be/Kpiok_qpmJI):
1. Read about recent interview experiences.
2. Amazon asks behavioral questions in each technical round. So prepare this from the existing questions. Use STAR technique - Situation Task Action Result.
3. Operating system should be studied, it is asked. How: Use the GfG cheat sheet for OS.
4. Other topics - Networking, RDBMS (SQL).
5. Rounds:
	1. First - Priority Queue, Game Theory, some behavioral questions.
	2. Second - Previous work experience, projects. Asked about operating systems (deadlock, scheduling algorithms, segmentation, virtual memory), behavioral question.
	3. Third - medium string question, game theory question. No behavior questions asked.
	4. Bar Raiser round - to confirm if I can raise the bar of the team. Didn't prepare much. Previous projects, behavior questions, hard level coding question (binary-search).
